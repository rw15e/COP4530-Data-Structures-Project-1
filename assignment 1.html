<h2>Programming Assignment #1</h2>
Due: Thurs, Sept 28 (11:59 PM)

<h2>Objective</h2>
This assignment will provide practice with a doubly-linked list, along 
with practice on the basic concept of an iterator over a container.

<h2>Task</h2>

In your prior course, you probably saw an example of a singly-linked 
list.  Here is a simple example of such a container, implemented as a 
template class:  
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/deitel5c++/ch21/Fig21_03_05/">
Singly-Linked List class example</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For this assignment you will implement a templated doubly-linked list 
class, along with an associated iterator class for helping with generic 
list traversals. In a doubly-linked list, each node has a pointer to the 
next node AND a pointer to the previous node. The following starter 
files are provided for you:

</p><ul>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop4530/hw/hw1files/tnode.h"><tt>tnode.h</tt></a> -- fully defines a 
templated node class for use in a doubly-linked list.  Note that the 
member data includes a data element, as well as pointers to the next and 
previous nodes. </li>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop4530/hw/hw1files/tlist.h"><tt>tlist.h</tt></a> -- provides the 
<b>declarations</b> of the template classes <tt>TList</tt> (the linked 
list class) and <tt>TListIterator</tt> (an associated class to help with 
list traversal). </li>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop4530/hw/hw1files/driver.cpp"><tt>driver.cpp</tt></a> -- contains 
some sample test calls to the linked list, but should not be considered 
a complete or thorough set of tests. You will need to create more test 
cases to fully test your class features.  This driver is provided to 
help illustrate some of the basic class features and concepts, including 
the use of iterators.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop4530/hw/hw1files/driver_output.txt"><tt>driver_output.txt</tt></a> 
-- contains the output from running the above sample driver program 
</li>

</ul>


<p>Your job will be to finish this templated set of classes by defining 
each of the functions in the <tt>TList</tt> and <tt>TListIterator</tt> 
classes.  These should be defined in a file called:
</p><ul><tt>tlist.hpp</tt></ul>

Note that there is already a <tt>#include</tt> at the bottom of 
<tt>tlist.h</tt> where your definition file will be brought in.  This 
illustrates a pretty standard format for setting up a templated class.
<br>&nbsp;

<h2>Iterators</h2>

The small class called <tt>TListIterator</tt> is a helper class that 
can be used in conjunction with the linked list class.  This is a common 
feature used in container classes like this.  The purpose of an iterator 
is to provide a common and non-implementation-specific way of traversing 
a container, so that mulitple containers could potentially use common 
algorithms (like sorting and searching functions, for example).  This 
will be explored more in the course.  For the iterator class in this 
assignment, here is a brief sample use:

<pre>  // suppose that L is a linked list storing ints, and it has 
  //   already been populated with the values 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21

  // this call would retrieve a list iterator over the container L
  TListIterator&lt;int&gt; itr = L.GetIterator();

  // at this point, itr currently is positioned at the first element in 
  // the list (the 3).

  int x = itr.GetValue();		// x would now store 3
  itr.Next();				// itr has advanced to the 6
  int y = itr.GetValue();		// y would now store 6
  itr.Next();
  itr.Next();				// we have now advanced to the 12
  int z = itr.GetValue();		// z now stores 12
 
  itr.Previous();			// now we have moved backwards, to the 9
  int a = itr.GetValue();		// a stores 9.    etc.
</pre>
This class essentially helps us walk through the linked list in a fairly 
easy way, with calls to <tt>Next()</tt> and <tt>Previous()</tt> to move 
around.


<h2>Program Details</h2>

Here are general descriptions of the two classes you are to define, 
along with a general description of each function's task.

<h3>1) class TList</h3>

The member data of this class consists of pointers to the first and last 
nodes, a size variable, and a dummy variable of type T that can be used 
for error-checking situations. Specifically, some of the functions 
specify to return a stored data item, but if you encounter a situation 
like an empty list or other situation where there would not BE a valid 
data item, you can return a reference to the dummy object instead. This 
is needed because some such functions are pass-by-reference (so that the 
retrieved item can be modified by the caller under normal situations).

<p>Function descriptions
</p><ul>
<li><b>Default constructor</b> -- creates an empty linked list
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>TList(T val, int num)</b> -- creates a linked list containing 
"num" copies of the data element "val"
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>Clear</b> -- clear out the list, resetting it to an empty list
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>Big Five</b>
 <ul>
 <li>Destructor -- appropriate clean-up of list, no memory leaks</li>
 <li>Copy constructor -- deep copy</li>
 <li>Copy assignment operator -- deep copy</li>
 <li>Move constructor -- constructor with standard move semantics</li>
 <li>Move assignment operator -- assignment with standard move semantics</li>
 </ul>
<br>
</li>

<li><b>Accessors</b>
 <ul>
 <li><b>IsEmpty</b> -- returns true if the list is empty, false otherwise</li>
 <li><b>GetSize</b> -- returns the size (number of data elements) in the 
     list</li>
 <li><b>GetFirst</b> -- returns the data element in the first node 
     (by reference)</li>
 <li><b>GetLast</b> -- returns the data element in the last node 
     (by reference)</li>
 </ul>
 Note that error situations in the last two functions would occur if the 
 list was empty (this what the "dummy" item is for).
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>Endpoint insert/removes</b>
 <ul>
 <li><b>InsertFront</b> -- insert the data (parameter) as the first node 
        in the list</li>
 <li><b>InsertBack</b> -- insert the data (parameter) as the last node 
        in the list</li>
 <li><b>RemoveFront</b> -- remove the first element in the list. If the 
       list is empty, just leave it empty</li>
 <li><b>RemoveBack</b> -- remove the last element in the list. If the 
       list is empty, just leave it empty</li>
 </ul>
<br>
</li>

<li><b>Iterator retrieval</b>
 <ul>
 <li><b>GetIterator</b> -- create and return an iterator that is 
positioned on the first node in the list. If list is empty, return 
default iterator</li>
 <li><b>GetIteratorEnd</b> -- create and return an iterator that is 
positioned on the last node in the list. If list is empty, return 
default iterator</li>
 </ul>
<br>
</li>

<li><b>Insert (2 parameters)</b>
<br>The new data element (second parameter) should be inserted into the 
linked list just <i>before</i> the position given by the iterator (the 
first parameter).  If the list is empty, just insert the single item. If 
the iterator doesn't refer to a node, insert the item at the end of the 
list.
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>Remove (1 parameter)</b>
<br>This function should remove the data item that is given by the 
iterator (the parameter).  The function should return an iterator to the 
node that is <b>after</b> the one that was just deleted.  If the initial 
list was empty, there's nothing to delete -- so just leave it empty and 
return a default iterator.
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b>Print</b>
<br>Should print the entire list contents, front to back, separated by 
the delimiter given in the second parameter. This function 
may assume that the stored type T has an available insertion &lt;&lt; 
operator available for printing. Print to the stream given in the first 
parameter.  
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

<li><b><tt>operator+</tt></b>
<br>This is a standalone function that should return a TList object 
that is the result of concatenating two TList objects together -- in 
parameter order.  See driver.cpp program for examples.
<br>&nbsp;
</li>

</ul>


<h3>2) class TListIterator</h3>

The TListIterator class has only one member data variable -- a pointer 
to the Node to which it currently refers (we'll call this the current 
node in the function descriptions below).

<ul>

<li><b>Default constructor</b> -- a default iterator should just store 
the nunll pointer internally.
</li>

<li><b>HasNext</b> -- returns true if there is another node <i>after</i> 
the current node, false otherwise
</li>

<li><b>HasPrevious</b> -- returns true if there is another node <i>before</i> 
the current node, false otherwise
</li>

<li><b>Next</b> -- advances the iterator to the next node after the 
current one.  Returns an iterator to the new position.
</li>

<li><b>Previous</b> -- moves the iterator to the previous node (before 
the current one).  Returns an iterator to the new position.
</li>

<li><b>GetData</b> -- return the <i>data item</i> at the current node. 
If the iterator is not pointing to a node (i.e. null pointer), you can 
use the "dummy" that was defined previously.  Note that this is a return 
by reference.
</li>

</ul>

Define all of the functions for these two classes in the file 
<tt>tlist.hpp</tt>

<br>
<h3>3) Test Program</h3>

Create a test program of your own in the file 
<b><tt>mydriver.cpp</tt></b>.  You can use my provided driver.cpp as a 
general model of how to populate a linked list.  Your test program 
should contain the following tests/illustrations at a minimum:

<ul>
<li>Tests of all of the functions</li>
<li>Tests that involve Linked Lists of at least two different stored 
types.  Suggested types:  int, double, char, string</li>
<li>At least 10 tests of each of the following
 <ul>
 <li>InsertFront</li>
 <li>InsertBack</li>
 <li>RemoveFront</li>
 <li>RemoveBack</li>
 <li>Insert (iterator-based)</li>
 <li>Remove (iterator-based)</li>
 </ul>
 The tests for each of these should not be all in a row for any single 
one.  I.e. for best testing, make sure that insert/remove calls of a 
single function type are frequently interspersed between other types.  
(This way, a mistake in one will often be revealed by later calls to 
others)
</li>

<li>Clear illustrations of list contents with Print before and after 
major sets of insert/delete tests.  Make your outputs readable and 
easy to follow for best testing/results.</li>

<li>At least one test that uses an iterator to traverse the list front 
to back</li>

<li>At least one test that uses an iterator to traverse the list back 
to front</li>

</ul>

<h3>4) makefile</h3>

Create a makefile that configures a build of both my provided driver 
(driver.cpp) and your test program (mydriver.cpp).  i.e. when you type 
"make" in the directory, it should compile and build both executables.  
Make your executables named "driver.x" and "mydriver.x", respectively.

<h3>5) General Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Document your code appropriately so that it is readable and easy to 
navigate</li>

<li>You may use standard C++ I/O libraries, as well as class libraries 
like <tt>string</tt>.  You may <b>NOT</b> use any of the container class 
libraries from the STL</li>

<li>If you wish to add any helper functions to the TList class, you may 
modify the tlist.h file for this purpose.  But do NOT change any of the 
expected interface function prototypes or add extra member data.  Any 
helper functions you write should be in the private section</li>

<li>Make sure your files compile and run on linprog.cs.fsu.edu with 
g++, using the C++11 standard compilation flag.  This is where they 
will be tested and graded</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deliverables and submitting</h3>

These are the deliverable files you should submit:
<pre>  tlist.h
  tlist.hpp
  mydriver.cpp
  makefile
</pre>

To submit, package up your files in a tar archive and upload this at the 
assignment submission link on the Blackboard course site (in the 
"Assignments" section).  Your tar file should be named in this format, 
all lowercase:

<pre>   <i>lastname_firstname_p1.tar</i>

   Example:  My tar file would be:    <b>myers_bob_p1.tar</b>
</pre>

After submitting, make sure to download your submission and verify it is 
correct.  You are responsible for submitting the correct version of your 
assignment.  If you cannot download your submission, contact the 
Blackboard support team at FSU.

<p>Note that in addition to the provided test cases, we will also test 
your program/classes using additional test programs.  Your program must 
be able to pass all such test cases to obtain a full score for the 
corresponding components.
